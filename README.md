may the sleep be with mailin.

My wife needed a small tool to display song texts to get your baby asleep
although she's doing a really god job. Probably it was just a small hint for me
to join singing ;-)

Some features I'm currently thiking of are:

* downloadable song texts from configurable url
* scalable song text display
* make compatible to api v4 so this runs on my galaxy i7500
